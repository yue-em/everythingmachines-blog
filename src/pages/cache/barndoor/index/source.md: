## Uncontrolled MCP Access = Unacceptable Risk

#### MCP Unlocks Context

It lets AI apps connect to core 
business systems.

#### But Access Is Wide Open

AI apps can read, write, or delete 
without limits.

#### So Adoption Gets Stalled

Enterprises silo AI, limiting its potential.

## Trusted AI Demands MCP Security

Barndoor is the control plane that governs how AI apps use MCP servers — enforcing policies by user, role, app, and system so you can adopt AI safely.
