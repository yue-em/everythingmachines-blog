## Problem Clay Solves

Sales teams frequently spend valuable hours manually researching prospects across numerous disconnected data sources and tools. This inefficiency slows down deal pipelines and diverts valuable sales time towards data aggregation rather than direct selling. Clay solves this by consolidating over 130 data sources with AI research automation. This allows teams to efficiently build enriched prospect lists and trigger outbound sequences from one unified platform, maximizing their time on revenue-generating activities.

## Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros

**Integrated Data Enrichment Engine:** Clay offers a data enrichment engine, providing access to a vast network of premium data providers and the flexibility to connect existing API keys, ensuring maximum data coverage and quality for prospects.

**Automated Outreach Workflows:** Combines database enrichment, AI-powered copywriting, lead scoring, and multi-channel outreach in a single platform for streamlined GTM execution.

**No-code Scalability:** Enables non-technical GTM teams to design, launch, and adjust complex workflows without coding, accelerating deployment and reducing dependency on engineering.

### ⚠️ Cons

**Credit-Based Cost Structure:** Usage-based credits for enrichment and AI functions can lead to unpredictable monthly costs as volume and feature usage evolve.

**Overlapping Tool Functionality:** Core capabilities like workflows and outreach copying can be replicated using cheaper combinations of spreadsheets, open-source automation, and standalone tools.

**Complex Setup for Optimal Use:** Maximizing ROI requires designing waterfall enrichment flows, customizing AI agents, and integrating with CRM systems, which demands planning and skilled execution.
