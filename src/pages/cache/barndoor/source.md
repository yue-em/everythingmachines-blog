# Adopt AI Safely with MCP Security

Barndoor is the control plane that governs how AI apps interact with MCP servers â€” enforcing least-privilege policies by user, role, app, and system, with real-time monitoring and auditable logs.

## Highlights
- Policy enforcement across users, roles, apps, and systems  
- Fine-grained control over read/write/delete actions  
- Real-time visibility and audit trails  
- Integrates with SSO/IdP, logging, and monitoring
