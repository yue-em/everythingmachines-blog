# We are moving from search & discover to ask & answer

## Search & Discover
Today's online GTM strategies are built around twenty+ years of SEM and SEO. Brands tailor their content and marketing campaigns around keywords indexed by algorithmic search engines to drive sales leads and conversions.

The strategies and tactics are well understood and measurable.

**Traditional Search Engines:**
- Google
- Bing  
- Amazon

â†“

## Ask & Answer
AI GTM requires designing distribution and conversion strategies for Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity, Llama and Claude. These services try to give users unique answers to their questions based on "reasoning," not solely on keywords.

The strategies and tactics are completely different than SEM/SEO.

**Leading AI Platforms:**
- OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- Perplexity
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Meta AI (Llama)

## AI Visibility Audit & Tracking

**How visible is your brand across the leading LLMs?**

**How does your brand visibility compare with your competitors?**

**Which audiences do the LLMs associate with your brand?**

We create custom reports that answer these and other questions to inform your AI GTM strategy and audience targeting. We can customize your audit by brand, audience, and topic.

## Strategy & Implementation 

Building on your Brand's AI Visibility Audit, we create an LLM strategy to make sure the LLMs truly understand what your brand is about - what it truly means to humans.

This is the key to making sure the LLMs are working on your behalf to reach the audiences you care about with personalized and contextually relevant answers that drive leads, conversions and growth.

We can augment your in-house development resources with architects and engineering teams to implement strategic recommendations from prototype to production.
