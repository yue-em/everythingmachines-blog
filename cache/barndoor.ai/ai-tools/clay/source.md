## Problem Clay Solves

Sales teams spend valuable hours manually researching prospects across disconnected data sources. Clay consolidates over 130 data sources with AI research automation to build enriched prospect lists and trigger outbound sequences from one unified platform.

## Pros

### Integrated Data Enrichment Engine
Clay combines 130+ data sources including Apollo, ZoomInfo, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator into one unified platform, eliminating the need to manage multiple subscriptions and data silos.

### Automated Outreach Workflows
AI-powered research agents automatically gather prospect information, craft personalized messages, and trigger email sequences based on enriched data points and behavioral triggers.

### No-code Scalability
Visual workflow builder allows sales teams to create complex data enrichment and outreach sequences without technical expertise, scaling personalized outbound from dozens to thousands of prospects.

## Cons

### Credit-Based Cost Structure
Clay's pricing model charges credits for each data enrichment action, which can become expensive for high-volume prospecting compared to flat-rate alternatives.

### Overlapping Tool Functionality
Many features duplicate capabilities found in existing CRM and sales engagement platforms, potentially creating workflow redundancy for teams with established tech stacks.

### Complex Setup for Optimal Use
Maximizing Clay's potential requires significant upfront configuration of data sources, AI prompts, and workflow logic, creating a steep learning curve for new users.
